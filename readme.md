# AntTweakBar

Nim wrapper for the ant tweak bar library. At the moment it is only tested on linux, but it should work on other platforms, too. If there are problems with other platforms please report them.

## SDL2 support

Yes there is SDL2 support. The original library did miss this, I added this.

## Do I need AntTweakBar on my system?

No you do not need it. This library contains all source code of AntTweakBar and compiles it with the normal nim compilation command. No external libraries required.

## Documentation

For the documentation, please refer to the original documentataino at http://anttweakbar.sourceforge.net/doc/

## Help Wanted

I am a pure Linux developer. People who what to run this on Windows or OSX this should be possible,
but changes might be necessary. help is very welcome.
